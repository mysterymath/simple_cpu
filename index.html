<h1>A Very Simple CPU</h1>
<h2>What Does it Take?</h2> 
<p>If I wanted to make a CPU "from scratch," what would it take? What is the
simplest CPU that can be built? Inspired by <i>The Toaster Project</i>, I've
been exploring this question.

<p>Right off the bat, I realized that "simplest" is extremely subjective and
vague. Depending on how this word is interpreted, it could range anywhere
from manually wiring relays using copper wire to buying a CPU off the shelf.
For the game to be any fun, it'll need some rules. 

<p>If the rules are too strict, the project will be too difficult. If the
rules are too lenient, the project will be feel like cheating. Let's start on
the difficult side of things.

<h2>A CPU From Scratch</h2>
<p>To build a CPU from scratch, you must first create the universe.
Definitely too difficult. Let's assume a preexisting Earth. To create a CPU,
at the very least I'd need some kind of switching element. This means winding
relays from copper wire, blowing glass vaccuum tubes, or using sophisitical
chemical processes to manufacture semiconductors. Also too difficult. Now let's
vaccilate back to too easy.

<h2>A CPU From The Store</h2>
<p>The easiest way to make a CPU is to deposit a small amount of money into a
societal system that manufactures CPU's at scale, in exchange for one CPU's
worth of output. This is usually called "buying one." This is, of course, boring.

<p>A slightly less easy way to make a CPU is to purchase a FPGA or CPLD that
can be reconfigured into nearly any desired digital circuit. A CPU design
could then be downloaded from the Internet onto the chip. This is only
slightly more interesting than buying a CPU. I could write the configuration
myself, but this still woudln't feel like making a CPU. A FPGA is
specifically designed to be turned into something like a CPU; it's just a bit
too far from "from scratch" for my taste. Similar logic applies to pre-built
ALUs and the like.

<h2>A CPU From Non-CPU</h2>
<p>So, making the logic elements from scratch is too hard, so I'll have to buy
them. But buying a FPGA is too easy, since it's designed to become any
circuit you like, including a CPU. This suggests the following rules:

<ul>
    <li>Any parts purchased from the store must not be specifically intended
        for inclusion in a CPU.
    <li>No FPGAs, CPLDs or the like. Any parts purchased must be limited in
        the sorts of functions they can be made to compute.
    <li>The CPU should use as few components as possible.
    <li>The CPU should be integrable in a "real system", capable of doing
        usual computer things like I/O. The real system is not constrained by
        these rules.
</ul>

<h2>The non-CPU Parts of the System</h2>
<p>What must a CPU be connected to to be a working computer? Well, at the
very least, a memory. Without a memory, general computation cannot be
performed; only combinatorial logic. So, if we wanted to buy a simple memory,
what are our options?

<p>Let's say we want 64KB of RAM. 64KB is the largest amount that can be
indexed with two bytes; this seems like a good starting point. We'll want a
RAM chip with as simple an interface as possible; this will lighten the load
on our CPU and its support systems. The two main options are SRAM and DRAM.
DRAM requires continually refreshing the data, since it's leaking out. Sounds
complicated. SRAM it is. To Mouser!

<p>Let's look for the cheapest 64KB SRAM chip. Through hole, so we can put it
on a breadboard.
